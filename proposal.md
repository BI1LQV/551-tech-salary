## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data analyst consultancy firm

Target audience: Job seekers in the technology industry

Understanding salary trends in the technology sector is crucial for job seekers to make career decisions. To assist them, we propose developing a data visualization dashboard that enables users to explore and analyze tech salary data. This tool will help users identify factors influencing salary variations, such as job role, experience level, and location, thereby facilitating more strategic career planning.

## Description of the Data
We will utilize the [Tech Salary Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haominjiang/tech-salary-data) dataset from Kaggle, which has 62.6k records. This dataset includes variables such as `job title`, work at where (`company`, `location`), and the level of tech employees (`level`, `years of experience`), and the most important - `salary`. These variables provide insights into how different factors correlate with salary levels across various tech roles and regions.
