# Teamwork Contract

Work should be distributed in a **generally fair manner**, and all team members should contribute as agreed upon.

The actual workload distribution is **flexible and open to discussion**, but each member is expected to complete their tasks on time.

## Working Hours
Our standard working and reachable hours are **12 PM to 8 PM on weekdays**â€”we are not expected to work outside of these hours.

## Meetings
- We do not have a set meeting schedule. If discussions are needed, we can talk during **class or in the lab**.
- **Emergency online meetings** (via Zoom or group chat) can be scheduled at any time if necessary.
- There will be **no formal agendas or meeting minutes**.
- Any team member can **initiate a meeting**, and once agreed upon by the group, **attendance is mandatory unless there is a valid excuse**.

## Communication & Deadlines
- To maintain balance, we should **avoid late-night communication**, especially on weekends.
- We should not leave discussions or tasks unfinished **right before a deadline**.

## Work Quality
While we do not have a strict standard for work quality, each member is expected to **put in their best effort** and take responsibility for their assigned tasks.
