High-Level Description
This app contains a landing page that shows the distribution of tech salaries across various factors, including gender, country, city, years of experience, years at a company, education level, and time period. Users can set all these parameters using the interactive filters on the left panel to explore salary patterns dynamically.

At the core of the interface is an interactive world map that visualizes average salaries by city. The cities are represented by dots, with the color and size of each dot corresponding to salary levels. This allows users to identify salary trends across different regions.

To the right of the map, a violin plot displays the salary distribution across different job titles, such as Engineer, Data Scientist, and Manager. This visualization helps users understand how salaries vary across roles,and the density of the roles.

Below the map, a bar chart shows the salary distribution across various cities, allowing users to compare earnings geographically. Additionally, a line chart tracks salary changes over time, enabling users to analyze salary trends over the selected period.

Another key visualization is a bar chart displaying the top 10 companies with the highest salaries, helping users identify which organizations offer the most competitive compensation.

Finally, a pie chart at the bottom right presents the gender distribution of employees in the dataset, highlighting the proportion of male, female, and other gender identities.

All elements in the app are interactive, allowing users to filter and adjust parameters dynamically to explore different aspects of the dataset. This app provides an intuitive way to analyze tech salary data across multiple dimensions.
